Why do you want to get into IT world: since I'm already in IT, I'm interested in learning new directions to be better in the current position. 

Which problem will you be able to solve: basic knowledge of some technologies/libraries will give me a better understanding of how product are created. This, in turn, will help me to discuss clients'projects in more technology details. So, the problem at the current moment is not in-depth analysis of the project from business and technology perspectives.
